# YieldClustering
this code is to build kmeans model for clustering, 
and analyze the  differences between groups


## Data
the input should be the name of a pickle file, where dataframe is stored 


## Detect
we can use the class only to get predictions (cluster_analysis method)
and see the results of analysis (without training)


## Use
you can call test.py file giving two arguments, 
first is the file name ('train.pkl'), 
and the second should be a string: 'yes' (if you want train model) or
'no' (if you want to see only the results of a pre-designed model)
